Taking inspiration from Hitchcock’s Rear Window, each filmmaker contributed one roll of black and white celluloid film shot through a window of their house, documenting the visual aspects particular to their confinement. Together, these films form a portrait of domestic isolation, collectively examining the cinematic potential of the contemporary social order.</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/ncn0toMc1xsNQIKaBnNTAiBpoGe.jpg" ></img><h1>Original Title : Window</h1><p>ID: 811911</p<p>Overview : “A woman stands ironing near a window.

Finally she opens the bloody window for a breath of fresh air.” (Paul Winkler) [Made for Oberhausen Film Festival, which invited a number of filmmakers to make a three-minute film on the theme of a window.]</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/qfcslNbjRHzIYzBFqeyYODCNoQH.jpg" ></img><h1>Original Title : Window</h1><p>ID: 968911</p<p>Overview : An introspective look from filmmaker Alex Powell discussing the ramifications of online learning to COVID-Age college students.</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/eNmf4rknMFFT0B5nj8mcSwzgT39.jpg" ></img><h1>Original Title : Window</h1><p>ID: 659252</p<p>Overview : A young man in suburbia develops a fascination with his neighbour.

A static, formal elegance masks the teeming energy coursing through its electronic heart.</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/4nuZUd6ySCznnM8A2eHp3MT02P4.jpg" ></img><h1>Original Title : Window</h1><p>ID: 347283</p<p>Overview : The moving camera shapes the screen image with great purposefulness, using the frame of a window as fulcrum upon which to wheel about the exterior scene. The zoom lens rips, pulling depth planes apart and slapping them together, contracting and expanding in concurrence with camera movements to impart a terrific apparent-motion to the complex of the object-forms pictured on the horizontal-vertical screen, its axis steadied by the audience's sense of gravity. The camera's movements in being transferred to objects tend also to be greatly magnified (instead of the camera the adjacent building turns). About four years of studying the window-complex preceded the afternoon of actual shooting (a true instance of cinematic action-painting). The film exists as it came out of the camera barring one mechanically necessary mid-reel splice</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/wFgHsLpXVrXTmPr4Brjz77zc8NA.jpg" ></img><h1>Original Title : window</h1><p>ID: 1190718</p<p>Overview : Scenes from a window.</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/oITD5AAw8CRXtOAGNtCBOs5soWa.jpg" ></img><h1>Original Title : Window</h1><p>ID: 1241009</p<p>Overview : Perspectives shift when lenses tilt.</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/8U7gQulgjJQMPvX2hmmRIH4R16V.jpg" ></img><h1>Original Title : Window</h1><p>ID: 1262832</p<p>Overview : </p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/nmlHOCCwmRY3BW9JmRiWie6zE6r.jpg" ></img><h1>Original Title : Window</h1><p>ID: 1277772</p<p>Overview : The second [Geki Yaba] short horror story by Koji Shiraishi.</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/3wkARMqFAzsn71jbJ3Ym6ZNN1pQ.jpg" ></img></div></html>
