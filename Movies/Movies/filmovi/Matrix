The wooden lattice fence, visible in the image, marks the border between enclosed and open, private and public space, and forms both a fulcrum for the work and a formal grid by which the shots are framed and organised.</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/AfFD10ZqEx2vkxM2yvRZkybsGB7.jpg" ></img><h1>Original Title : Matrix</h1><p>ID: 775293</p<p>Overview : "MATRIX is a flicker film which utilizes 81 still photographs of my wife's head. It is a film dependent upon variation of intense light changes by calculated combinations of black and white frame alternations with exposure changes. Throughout, the light intensity rises and falls as the head rotates in varying directions within a 360 degree frontal area." — James Cagle</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/frDqG8rmqKUg4HzQ604LZo8VLHB.jpg" ></img><h1>Original Title : The Matrix</h1><p>ID: 603</p<p>Overview : Set in the 22nd century, The Matrix tells the story of a computer hacker who joins a group of underground insurgents fighting the vast and powerful computers who now rule the earth.</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/f89U3ADr1oiB1s9GkdPOEpXUk5H.jpg" ></img><h1>Original Title : Matrix</h1><p>ID: 373223</p<p>Overview : Abstract art film made for gallery exhibition.</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/wx2s9xYeC6uP2auuuVg99yl4RpU.jpg" ></img><h1>Original Title : The Matrix Resurrections</h1><p>ID: 624860</p<p>Overview : Plagued by strange memories, Neo's life takes an unexpected turn when he finds himself back inside the Matrix.</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/8c4a8kE7PizaGQQnditMmI1xbRp.jpg" ></img><h1>Original Title : The Matrix Reloaded</h1><p>ID: 604</p<p>Overview : Six months after the events depicted in The Matrix, Neo has proved to be a good omen for the free humans, as more and more humans are being freed from the matrix and brought to Zion, the one and only stronghold of the Resistance.
