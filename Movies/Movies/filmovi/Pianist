It is a name that represents the highest degree of perfection, a quest for beauty that surpasses that of any other piano virtuoso. However Michelangeli also had a reputation for cancelling concerts at short notice and was consequently portrayed in the media as a somewhat neurotic artist. This documentary is the result of a 30-year search that has resulted in unusual interviews with those who knew him, and has also uncovered a wealth of new archive material: We get to experience Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli as he has never been seen before – and more importantly, as he has never been heard before. We also witness the maestro’s struggle back to his former perfection after suffering a devastating heart attack.</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/aGIr7AqnniZSh6Bdz8XKAGGUA1B.jpg" ></img><h1>Original Title : Las manos del pianista</h1><p>ID: 182803</p<p>Overview : In the town of Breda, a construction company wants to build a luxury urbanization development in the suburbs.
