In the present, that term was replaced by a definition that is closer to reality—they were women who had been kidnapped and turned into sex slaves. After a long period of humiliation, the victims remained quiet, but some of them built up the courage to write about their ordeals in a series of letters. Cecilia Kang’s new documentary recovers those testimonies in order to talk about the way in which History and social mandates affect the lives of Korean women in Argentina, from the perspective of a young acting student who, after coming into contact with this correspondence, allows herself to reflect on the community she lives in and understand more about the traditions of her people as well as her own family history.</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/6xn6nfZzUObRuuloUrD3AeuWVNh.jpg" ></img><h1>Original Title : 新妹魔王の契約者 DEPARTURES</h1><p>ID: 507732</p<p>Overview : The first movie based on the TV Series The Testament of Sister New Devil, takes place right after the season 2 final.</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/aKt2UZ8auyRGYoNMcLajmwgLxoJ.jpg" ></img><h1>Original Title : 手塚治虫のブッダ -赤い砂漠よ!美しく-</h1><p>ID: 115969</p<p>Overview : Prince Siddhartha is heir to the Shakya kingdom, which is constantly at war with the more powerful Kosala kingdom.
