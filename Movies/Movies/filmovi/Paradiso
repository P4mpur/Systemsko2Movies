The wisened Calabrian invites the viewer into his sun-washed world of bright orange sun umbrellas, cool blue seas, freshly baked pastries and fresh vegetables.  Directed by Jan Vrhovnik, written by Ana Kerin and music score by Oscar-winning Nico Casal, Paradiso is less story and more a poetic thought piece. Dipping into a snapshot of life for an aging man from Italy, whimsical moments like the swatting of a fly are interspersed with provocative thoughts on life that can only come with the wisdom of an older man who has seen it all.</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/89rH21xlg35jQVLxjmXMUKERVFS.jpg" ></img><h1>Original Title : Paradiso</h1><p>ID: 140108</p<p>Overview : A documentary about Amsterdam's music and cultural venue Paradiso.</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500" ></img><h1>Original Title : Paradiso</h1><p>ID: 1239411</p<p>Overview : </p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500" ></img><h1>Original Title : L'ultimo paradiso</h1><p>ID: 746422</p<p>Overview : In 1950s Italy, a farmer's dream of improving workers’ living conditions collapses when he falls for a landowner's daughter.
